abstract={Absolute separable states is a kind of separable state that remain separable under the action of any global unitary transformation. These states may or may not have quantum correlation and these correlations can be measured by quantum discord. We find that the absolute separable states are useful in quantum computation even if it contains infinitesimal quantum correlation in it. Thus to search for the class of two-qubit absolute separable states with zero discord, we have derived an upper bound for {\$}{\$}Tr({\backslash}varrho ^{\{}2{\}}){\$}{\$}, where {\$}{\$}{\backslash}varrho {\$}{\$}denoting all zero discord states. In general, the upper bound depends on the state under consideration but if the state belong to some particular class of zero discord states then we found that the upper bound is state independent. Later, it is shown that among these particular classes of zero discord states, there exist sub-classes which are absolutely separable. Furthermore, we have derived necessary conditions for the separability of a given qubit--qudit states. Then, we used the derived conditions to construct a ball for {\$}{\$}2{\backslash}otimes d{\$}{\$}quantum system described by {\$}{\$}Tr({\backslash}rho ^{\{}2{\}}){\backslash}le Tr(X^{\{}2{\}})+2Tr(XZ)+Tr(Z^{\{}2{\}}){\$}{\$}, where the {\$}{\$}2{\backslash}otimes d{\$}{\$}quantum system is described by the density operator {\$}{\$}{\backslash}rho {\$}{\$}which can be expressed by block matrices X, Y and Z with {\$}{\$}X,Z{\backslash}ge 0{\$}{\$}. In particular, for qubit--qudit system, we show that the newly constructed ball contain larger class of absolute separable states compared to the ball described by {\$}{\$}Tr({\backslash}rho ^{\{}2{\}}){\backslash}le {\backslash}frac{\{}1{\}}{\{}3{\}}{\$}{\$}. Lastly, we have derived the necessary condition in terms of purity for the absolute separability of a qubit--qudit system under investigation.},

abstract = {In a scenario where two parties share, act on and exchange some physical resource, the assumption that the parties’ actions are ordered according to a definite causal structure yields constraints on the possible correlations that can be established. We show that the set of correlations that are compatible with a definite causal order forms a polytope, whose facets define causal inequalities. We fully characterize this causal polytope in the simplest case of bipartite correlations with binary inputs and outputs. We find two families of nonequivalent causal inequalities; both can be violated in the recently introduced framework of process matrices, which extends the standard quantum formalism by relaxing the implicit assumption of a fixed causal structure. Our work paves the way to a more systematic investigation of causal inequalities in a theory-independent way, and of their violation within the framework of process matrices.}

abstract = {The idea that events are equipped with a partial causal order is central to our understanding of physics in the tested regimes: given two pointlike events A and B, either A is in the causal past of B, B is in the causal past of A, or A and B are space-like separated. Operationally, the meaning of these order relations corresponds to constraints on the possible correlations between experiments performed in the vicinities of the respective events: if A is in the causal past of B, an experimenter at A could signal to an experimenter at B but not the other way around, while if A and B are space-like separated, no signaling is possible in either direction. In the context of a concrete physical theory, the correlations compatible with a given causal configuration may obey further constraints. For instance, space-like correlations in quantum mechanics arise from local measurements on joint quantum states, while time-like correlations are established via quantum channels. Similarly to other variables, however, the causal order of a set of events could be random, and little is understood about the constraints that causality implies in this case. A main difficulty concerns the fact that the order of events can now generally depend on the operations performed at the locations of these events, since, for instance, an operation at A could influence the order in which B and C occur in A’s future. So far, no formal theory of causality compatible with such dynamical causal order has been developed. Apart from being of fundamental interest in the context of inferring causal relations, such a theory is imperative for understanding recent suggestions that the causal order of events in quantum mechanics can be indefinite. Here, we develop such a theory in the general multipartite case. Starting from a background-independent definition of causality, we derive an iteratively formulated canonical decomposition of multipartite causal correlations. For a fixed number of settings and outcomes for each party, these correlations form a polytope whose facets define causal inequalities. The case of quantum correlations in this paradigm is captured by the process matrix formalism. We investigate the link between causality and the closely related notion of causal separability of quantum processes, which we here define rigorously in analogy with the link between Bell locality and separability of quantum states. We show that causality and causal separability are not equivalent in general by giving an example of a physically admissible tripartite quantum process that is causal but not causally separable. We also show that there are causally separable quantum processes that become non-causal if extended by supplying the parties with entangled ancillas. This motivates the concepts of extensibly causal and extensibly causally separable (ECS) processes, for which the respective property remains invariant under extension. We characterize the class of ECS quantum processes in the tripartite case via simple conditions on the form of the process matrix. We show that the processes realizable by classically controlled quantum circuits are ECS and conjecture that the reverse also holds.}

In the present work, we show that some useless (for communication) channels may provide useful communication under the action of quantum switch for several information-theoretic tasks: quantum random access codes, quantum steering, etc. We demonstrate that the quantum switch can also be useful in preventing the loss of coherence in a system when only coherence-breaking channels are the available channels for communication. We also show that if a useless quantum channel does not provide useful communication even after using a quantum switch, concatenating the channel with another suitable quantum channel, and subsequently using the switch, one may achieve useful communication. Finally, we discuss how the introduction of noise in the quantum switch can reduce the advantage that the switch provides.}
